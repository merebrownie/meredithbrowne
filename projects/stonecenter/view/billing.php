        <h2>Billing & Insurance</h2>
        <div id="billing">
            The Stone Center For Counseling & Leadership currently participates with the following insurance companies:
            <img src="../media/filldoc.jpg" alt="Forms" class="imgRight">
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Cross/Blue Shield</li>
                <li>PPO Policies From Other Insurance Carriers</li>
            </ul>
            Many insurance companies cover our services as an Out of Network Provider.<br>

            Please contact your insurance carrier prior to your initial session to verify coverage, deductibles, and co-insurance or any other fees you are responsible for.<br><br>

            You may also need to obtain prior authorization for outpatient services. You are responsible to know the parameters of your insurance policy and are ultimately responsible for any outstanding balance if your insurance company does not cover your fees for any reason.<br>

            We will be happy to assist you in verifying your insurance benefits.
