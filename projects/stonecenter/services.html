                Individual counseling is a cooperative and respectful process between therapist and client to facilitate change.
                As a client, you will be provided a safe, confidential, and supportive environment to pursue the work and change for
                which you seek. Engaging in counseling during challenging times takes courage and commitment. The benefits of counseling
                can lead to greater self-awareness, insight and strength to face the challenges of life and to find joy and meaning.

                Couples counseling is intended to offer hope and nourishment to any relationship in distress. The safety and intentionality
                that comes with couples counseling is often what is needed to reconnect you with your significant other and foster healthy
                forms of communication. Couples therapy can also be used in more proactive ways to improve a relationship. Nothing better
                equips you to face the stresses of life than the support and strength that comes from a healthy, full marriage.

                Adolescents today face many issues and challenges that can lead to feeling overwhelmed and confused. These years can be a time of great vulnerability for a teen which may lead to poor choices and problematic behavior.  The adolescent years are riddled with transitional issues - physical and emotional changes along with the desire to establish independence from their parents, which can result in feelings of confusion and discouragement.  Teens often don't have the needed coping skills to deal with this significant distress which may lead to your teen engaging in risky behaviors or becoming depressed and/or anxious.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Sometimes, adolescents may just need someone outside of their family to discuss the stressors they are dealing with and help them relieve the pressure they feel.  For others, who are dealing with more severe issues such as depression, anxiety, violent behaviors, sexual acting out, school/home behavioral problems, or substance abuse, will need more significant intervention.

                <img src="media/playroom2.jpg" alt="Playroom" class="imgRight">
                Most children go through difficult times, such as divorce of their parents, trouble making friends, or adjusting to changes at school or home. Some children need more help than others to get through these times. Play therapy is the most appropriate treatment for helping children work through difficult times and helping parents gain a better understanding of what their child is going through.
                </p>
                <p>
                <img src="media/playroom3.jpg" alt="Playroom" class="imgLeft">
                Children ages 3-10 benefit most from play therapy versus traditional "talk therapy" as they can more effectively process through difficult situations and difficult emotions through play. What counseling and psychotherapy aim to do for adults, play therapy aims to do for children. Through play therapy, children learn to communicate with others, express feelings, modify behavior, develop problem-solving skills, and learn a variety of ways of relating to others. Play provides a safe psychological distance from their problems and allows expression of thoughts and feelings appropriate to their development.

                Play therapy allows trained mental health practitioners who specialize in play therapy, to assess and understand children's play. Further, play therapy is utilized to help children cope with difficult emotions and find solutions to problems.

                The practice of play therapy requires extensive specialized education, training, and experience. A play therapist is a licensed (or certified) mental health professional who has earned a Master's or Doctorate degree in a mental health field with considerable general clinical experience and supervision.

                With advanced, specialized training, experience, and supervision, mental health professionals may also earn the Registered Play Therapist (RPT) or Registered Play Therapist-Supervisor (RPT-S) credentials. The Stone Center for Counseling & Leadership has several experienced play therapists on staff who specialize in play therapy and child-related issues.

                Families often need and seek support to make it through the challenges everyday life. Family counseling can

                help families improve communication and resolve conflict. Intended to improve connections among family members, family counseling impacts families to grow and change both individual members and the family as a whole.
                <img src="media/family2.jpg" alt="Happy Family Photo" class="imgLeft" style="width: 40%">
                The health of the family also plays a large role when working with divorced and blended families. Strengthening the family relationships, co-parenting abilities, and decreasing family conflict allow children to thrive.
