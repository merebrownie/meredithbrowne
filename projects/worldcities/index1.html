                        forgotten its past, as attested by sites such as Ho Chi
                        Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison. Lakes, parks, shady
                        boulevards, and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to
                        the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi.
