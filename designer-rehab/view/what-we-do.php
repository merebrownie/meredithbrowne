    <p style="text-align: center;">As a project manager and design consultant for many years, I know that the most stressful part of owning a home or business is maintaining it and keeping it current.  Our properties are, generally, our greatest investments.  The majority of homes and offices routinely need some type of "rehabilitation" to maximize their potential.  To meet this need and to be an asset to you, Designer-Rehab provides design services, contractor coordination, material selection, and site management throughout the process of renovation and construction.  This process can be very overwhelming and it is WHAT I DO BEST!  My specialty is making sure that your project is exactly the way you envisioned it, that it is as stress free as possible and that it is completed in a timely and cost efficient manner.  I would love the opportunity to discuss my company with you and answer any questions you may have!</p>
