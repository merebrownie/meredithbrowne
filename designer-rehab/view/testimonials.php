        <p>Robin has assisted us over the years with several homes across the country. She always has fabulous suggestions that help us create warm, inviting living spaces. Most recently, Robin completely reorganized the inefficient layout of our family summer cottage. We were able to use our existing furniture and accessories, adding only one $278 item. Family and friends love the new, improved design.</p>

        <p>Robin was absolutely wonderful to work with during the remodel of my two upstairs bathrooms. She provided me with a gorgeous selection of options, all within budget! It was so nice to have someone willing to do all the legwork, as well as come to my home every day to make sure things were being done properly and according to plan. I am so thrilled with the quality of the finished product! She took a home built in the 1980's and made it look current with the gorgeous updates!</p>

        <p>As a single mom, having my home on the market was very stressful. Robin helped me complete the many changes recommended by my realtor, resulting in a sale!  I could not have done it without her.</p>
